Title : Titanic Survival Prediction

Overview : Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

About the Dataset :

We are using the Titanic Dataset here. It contains both numerical and string values.

In this project, I explored the task using a bar chart to understand more deep. My analysis revealed valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness in capturing the variability in survival people.

The Titanic Survival Prediction project was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into the intricacies of predictive modeling and its knowledge about the survival people. The successful implementation of the demonstrated the potential for data-driven decision-making in optimizing .
